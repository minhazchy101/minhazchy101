## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate web developer skilled in both frontend and backend technologies. I specialize in building responsive and interactive websites using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase** on the frontend, and **Express.js** with **MongoDB** on the backend.  

I love learning new tools, solving real-world problems, and turning ideas into digital reality. Currently, I'm focusing on developing full-stack web applications and improving my backend architecture skills.
